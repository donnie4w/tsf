## TSF Network Framework

### 1. Design Goals

##### High-Performance Transmission
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for high-volume data transmission needs, supporting high throughput.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for low-latency communication, suitable for real-time or near-real-time applications.

##### Flexibility
- **Multiple Protocols Support**: Supports various network communication protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, etc., meeting the needs of different scenarios.
- **Service Discovery Mechanism**: Supports service discovery mechanisms like DNS, Consul, Etcd, etc., facilitating management and location of services in distributed environments.

##### Ease of Integration
- **Convenient API Interfaces**: Provides rich API interfaces, making it easy for developers to integrate into existing systems.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Offers detailed documentation and sample code to help developers get started quickly.

### 2. Key Features

##### Optimized Network Transport Layer
- **Enhanced Transmission Efficiency**: Optimizes the underlying network transport layer to improve transmission efficiency.
- **Adaptive Network Conditions**: Supports dynamic adjustment of transmission strategies based on current network conditions, adapting to different network environments.

##### TLS Support
- **Built-in Encryption**: Built-in support for TLS to ensure the security of data transmission.
- **Certificate Management**: Supports certificate installation, updates, and unloading, simplifying certificate maintenance.

##### Concurrency Handling Capability
- **Utilization of Go's Concurrency Features**: Utilizes Go language features such as goroutines and channels to achieve efficient concurrency handling.
- **Load Balancing**: Supports load balancing mechanisms to ensure stability under high-concurrency scenarios.

### 3. Components and Modules

##### Transport Layer
- **Connection Management**: Responsible for establishing and managing network connections.
- **Data Transmission**: Responsible for sending and receiving data, supporting reliable data transmission mechanisms.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Maintains the active state of long-lived connections to ensure their validity.

##### Security Layer
- **Encryption Mechanism**: Provides data encryption functions to protect data during transmission.
- **Authentication Mechanism**: Supports mutual authentication to ensure the identity of both communicating parties.
- **Certificate Management**: Supports installation, updates, and unloading of certificates.

##### Data Layer
- **Data Compression**: Supports data compression to reduce the amount of transmitted data and improve transmission efficiency.
- **Data Merging Transmission**: Supports data merging transmission mechanisms to reduce the number of network requests and lower network overhead.
